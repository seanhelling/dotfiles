# dotfiles
## Description
These are the configuration files I use for my shell. They make my shell prettier, and my day-to-day life a little easier.

## Caveats
Keep in mind that these files are for my own personal use, and I'm sharing them as-is. I'm sure some of the code is terrible. Please don't blame me if something I did is not compatible with your system. Absolutely no effort was made to mitigate that.
